# Ramanujan Numbers(SUm) 
Given a positive integer L, the task is to find all the Ramanujan Numbers that can be generated by any set of quadruples (a, b, c, d), where 0 &lt; a, b, c, d â‰¤ L.  Ramanujan Numbers are the numbers that can be expressed as sum of two cubes in two different ways.  Therefore, Ramanujan Number (N) = a3 + b3 = c3 + d3.
